I finally decided to get serious about this! I've outlined my plan and will hopefully begin tomorrow.

I also want to test how \LaTex looks here. Hereâ€™s some inline math: \\( E = mc^2 \\)

Also, a block equation:
\\(
\int_0^\\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2}
\\)

Never mind, that's still an inline equation. I'll figure it out later.
