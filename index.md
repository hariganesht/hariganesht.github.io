# Hello!

I am a third year undergraduate. My interests sit at the intersection of Bayesian modeling, AI alignment, and cognitive science.

Previously, I studied neurological imaging models to detect the early onset of Dementia in Alzheimer's patients on a collaborative project between IIT Madras and UIUC.

Here you can find my **projects**, **blog**, and **CV**.
